TODAY'S TASK
 1. - When sender is sending the message it should not go to the chat box :
     - we will add up a number to the row of sender's id.
     - when reciever clicks on the id then only chat box opens up with the sender's message.
     - while clicking on the id the clicked id of the reciever would change with the sender's id.


     --- 

     - current click id depends on the last click - change it - for this you can take the the clicked id and the socket id and then can match / the clicked id of the same socket can help
     - need to push the message if click id is not same as sender's id
